# Dev lanes

Staging tracks `main`. A lane is separate: a Preview lane deploys a chosen branch on demand, and an agent lane is for agents.

Push a branch named `lane/<you>` to deploy its current commit:

```sh
git push origin HEAD:lane/yourname
```

From the **Dev lane** GitHub Actions workflow, select that branch and dispatch `deploy`, `status`, `down`, or `reset`. A push deploys automatically. `down` stops the lane. `reset` stops its services, wipes the lane's disposable Anthropic workspace, removes its database volume, then redeploys the recorded image. The workspace must carry the disposable marker used by the contract tests; reset refuses to wipe without it.

Each lane uses its own environment and repository variables for deployment. The host keeps the lane's secrets in a root-owned `.env` file. No container ports are published by this Compose file.
