# mux

The provider-neutral managed-agent contract: types, port protocols, errors,
profiles and admission, with one driver package per provider under
`mux/drivers/`. Daimon does not call it yet.

The import name is the top-level `mux`, not `daimon.mux`, so it can be split
into its own repository without a rename. `mux` never imports `daimon`, and
only `mux.drivers.<provider>` imports that provider's SDK; import-linter
contracts in the root `pyproject.toml` enforce both.

Install a driver's SDK with its extra: `daimon-mux[anthropic]`,
`daimon-mux[openai]` or `daimon-mux[gemini]`.

The full description is [docs/mux.md](../../docs/mux.md). Tests:
`uv run pytest packages/mux`.
